<p>In the past, I have done a little bit of design courses for developing my photography portfolio. I have not done any programming at all throughout my school years.  I am studying this course because I think software engineering provides many opportunities to make myself an impactful contributor to my society. Occasionally, I watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ap2uWsJV25w">Youtube Video</a> that the author talks about his ten years as programmer.  I found this video is really inspirational and decided I can to be a good programmer too.  Therefore, I started my journey here in UTS. Started from March, 2020.  By now, I have been involved in a range of IT related learning activities such as:</p>

        <li>Lectures and tutorials.</li>
        <li>Group working.</li>
        <li>FEIT community.</li>
    </ol>
<p>By attending the classes and self teach, I have developed a fundamental understanding about </p>
        <ol class="inside">
        <li>How to build a Web server.</li>
        <li>How to make a webpage like this.</li>
        <li>The comtribution of information system in society.</li>
        <li>Various programming language.</li>
        </ol>
    <p class="subheader">Wokring Experience</p>
        <P>In the past I have done various type of works, such as working in a restaurant, food delivery and photography.  Through these working experiences, I learnt communication skills, how working as a team and problem solving.  However, I have lost my job due to the pandemic.</P>
